     Whenever we are going to return a game we will append the game back to the end of the game library array and then we'll set the

     For convinence I set this date to a string as it is easier to display and write to a file. that would've worked with the DataImporter class
     Unfortunately, I never finished the DataImporter class. The game still functions like normal but doesn't have a save feature.
