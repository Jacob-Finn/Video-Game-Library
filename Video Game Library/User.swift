 The user class was made in order to solve the two challenges that we were presented in class, the User class saves two variables. Age, and isAdmin. At any time the user types "SuperSecretPassword" the user.isAdmin gets set to true and allows for the user to add games in. Which usually a normal user wouldn't be allowed to do, and the age int is used in order to check if the user is old enough to check out a game.

        print("Please enter your age to determine what games you can buy!")

            guard let userAge = Int(userInput!) else {
                print("Please enter a number!")
                continue

            if userAge <= 0 {
