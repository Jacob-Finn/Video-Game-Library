 Data importer was going to be used as a save function that would create a text file inside of the project folder that would allow for me to save the game library and games that were currently checked out. It was capable of doing this by writing to the file the details of the game and then when the game was restarted before anything was displayed or done, the data importer would read through this file to see if there was any saved data that needed to be imported. Unfortunately, this was never completed, but it is at a state that it could be done fairly easily, and the dataImporter does actively create and save a game file. If you want to test it out just uncomment any lines dealing with it in the menu class.
 
 
 Update: The dataImporter does work now! It only saves the currentLibrary though, so any game that was checked out when the game is exited, is lost. Also, in order for it to work. You HAVE to quit the game like you normally would (By typing either quit or 8 into the console) otherwise you're killing the program immediately and not allowing for information to be saved or read. That being said. DO NOT MODIFY THE SAVE FILE AT ALL. If you do, you're usually better off just deleting the entire thing if you had no idea what you were doing. It is like corrupting a save file in a game.
